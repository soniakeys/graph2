Graph
=====

Graph implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Take a graph represented however you like, implement four methods to satisfy
interfaces, and call a function to get the shortest path between two nodes.

The methods you have to implement are really easy and there are examples
to look at.  If you can sort.Sort you can figure this out.
